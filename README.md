This is a Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.

### The Scenario

I'm a data analyst, working in the marketing analytics team at Cyclistic, a *fictional* bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. My task for this project is to understand **how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently** and **design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members**. But before that, executives must approve the recommendations, with well structured and compelling data insights and visualizations.

### The Company

**Business Model**

Since 2016, Cyclistic is a bike-sharing geotracked company across Chicago. 

Costumer types:

* Casual Rider, that purchase **single-ride** or **full-day** passes; and 
* Annual Member, that purchase an **annual** subscription. 

The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Bicycle variety:

* Classic;
* Electric; and
* Docked.

Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike.

**Stakeholders**

* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy;

* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing, is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program; and

* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

**Facts and Numbers**

* 5,824 bikes; 
* 692 docking stations;
* More than 50% of riders select traditional bikes;
* 8% of riders opt for the assistive bike options;
* 30% of users bike to commute to work each day;
* Users are more likely to ride for leisure; and
* Casual riders have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility need.

**Competitive advantages**

* Bicycle variety; 
* Pricing flexibility; and
* Adaptive tools to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike.

### The Problem

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that **annual members are much more profitable than casual riders**. Although the **pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers**, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.

Moreno has set a clear goal: **Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members**. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand:

* how annual members and casual riders differ; 
* why casual riders would buy a membership; and 
* how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
